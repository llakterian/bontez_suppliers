BEST PRACTICES
==============

1. DAILY ENTRY
   - Record accessories sales daily
   - Do it at end of day for accuracy
   - Include all cash, Mpesa, and other payments

2. NOTES
   - Record any special circumstances
   - Example: "Bulk order from shop X"
   - Helps with business analysis

3. REGULAR REVIEWS
   - Check weekly reports
   - Identify slow-moving items
   - Plan inventory based on sales trends

4. ACCURACY
   - Double-check quantities before saving
   - Verify total amounts match sales
   - Edit if you find errors

INTEGRATION WITH GAS SALES
==========================

Accessories tracking is separate from gas sales, but you can:

1. Record accessories WITH gas sales
   - Create a gas sale for a customer
   - Add accessory items to that sale
   - Track both in the sales module

2. Record accessories ONLY
   - Use Accessories module for standalone sales
   - Useful for walk-in customers
   - Quick daily cash totals

3. Mix both approaches
   - Use Sales module for customer accounts with gas
   - Use Accessories module for counter/walk-in sales
   - Both contribute to dashboard totals (in future updates)

DATABASE STRUCTURE
==================

Each accessory sale record stores:

- Sale date (automatic, one entry per day possible)
- Grill: quantity and total
- Burner variants: quantity and total for each price
- Regulator variants: quantity and total for each size
- Hose Pipe: quantity and total
- Notes
- Created and updated timestamps

This allows you to:
- See daily totals
- Track trends over time
- Identify your best-selling accessories
- Plan future inventory

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Q: Can I have two entries for the same day?
A: No. The system prevents duplicate entries for the same date.
   If you need to update today's entry, click "Edit".

Q: What if I forgot to record yesterday's sales?
A: Create a new entry and enter yesterday's date manually in the form.
   Edit after creation if needed.

Q: Can I delete an entry?
A: Contact admin. Currently entries are persistent for record-keeping.
   You can edit them to correct mistakes.

Q: Do accessories show in the main dashboard?
A: Not yet in this version. Dashboard focuses on gas sales.
   Accessories have their own section and reports.
